00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,251
I think he's the president.

181
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:51,557
Come on.

182
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,864
I know about what happened
with that, uh,

183
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:55,343
senator's nephew and you.

184
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,436
Somebody who didn't deserve it

185
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,565
got everything handed
to him,

186
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,524
just like Edwards.

187
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:03,613
I mean, the guy
was born into money.

188
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:06,009
He got preferential
treatment everywhere he went,

189
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:08,705
and, don't say anything,

190
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,533
but when his wife died,

191
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,102
he played the sympathy
card to get elected.

192
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:13,361
[Scoffing]

193
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:14,624
Wow.

We serve the chair,
not the man.

You sound like your uncle.

196
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:21,245
She sounds like somebody
who understands her job.

197
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:23,897
You know, in the future
you would do well

198
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:26,116
to keep your opinions to
yourself, Agent Richards.

199
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,288
Yes, sir.

200
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,889
[Sam] All right, let's go, move.

201
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:31,989
Move out.

204
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:37,984
Good job keeping
your mouth shut.

205
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,522
When he gave you the opportunity
to say how you feel--

206
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:43,000
Look, what I said at
the bar was between us.

207
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:45,306
This is my job.

208
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:48,399
Well, technically, right now,
I think doughnut duty is my job.

209
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:49,923
Don't worry about
doughnut patrol.

210
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,607
It's something
we do for rookies.

211
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:53,187
Usually, there's a guy
from commissary

212
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,580
who handles
the doughnuts and coffee.

213
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:56,535
They do that to see
if you complain.

214
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,974
Complainers don't last long.

215
00:08:58,058 --> 00:08:59,190
And I didn't complain.

216
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,803
Now, leave that be,
I already called.

217
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,413
Somebody from commissary
is gonna come pick that up.

218
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:04,720
Uncle Sam, I told you,
I don't want special treatment.

219
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:06,371
I got this.
- Allison,

220
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:08,501
you're not getting
any special treatment.

221
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,855
I need you to go home,
pack your stuff,

222
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,421
and get some sleep, okay?

223
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,120
I need you fresh tomorrow.
- What happens tomorrow?

224
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,209
One of my agents
called in sick,

225
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:19,732
so I need you on the team.

226

that we go, we go.

and very intelligent person.

248
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:30,281
Why would you think that
I would ever allow you

249
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:34,633
to broker a deal with
Americans for our oil?

"It's all about oil."

Yeah, it's all about the oil.

Oil that, thanks to the deal
you helped arrange,

255

gonna let anyone off alive?

Of course not.
Even if I do what Rodinov asks,

I don't think he's
gonna let anyone live.

00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:22,648
[Laughs softly]

891
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:27,697
You sound like my uncle.

892
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,748
That's the best compliment
you could give me, Agent Miles.

893
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:45,149
[Sighs]

894
00:46:49,153 --> 00:46:51,286
[birds chirping]

895
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:59,685
Did you know that your uncle
wasn't a big fan of mine

896
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,296
when he and I first met?

897
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:03,388
He never
mentioned that, sir.

898
00:47:03,472 --> 00:47:05,126
Well, he wouldn't, would he?

899
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:08,042
No, he would not.

900
00:47:09,217 --> 00:47:12,873
Well, he never said so much,
but I suspect that Sam thought

901
00:47:13,482 --> 00:47:16,182
that I had everything handed
to me on a silver platter.

902
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:18,139
Sam didn't think that, sir.

903
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,435
That's what everybody thinks.
- Sam respected you, sir.

904
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:22,752
We respected each other.

905
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,451
All my life people
have judged me

906
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:28,532
based on what they
think that they know.

907
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:30,586
I come from money.

908
00:47:30,716 --> 00:47:32,153
Everybody knows that.

909
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:35,765
What they don't know is
that right before college

910
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:39,290
I had a terrible fight
with my father,

911
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:44,556
and I did not take
one penny of his money.

912
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:47,037
He wanted to dictate
every step that I took,

913
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:48,825
and of course I had
to choose my own path,

914
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:52,825
so I worked two jobs,
I put myself through school,

915
00:47:53,826 --> 00:47:55,306
finished ROTC,

916
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:57,526
and then I flew jets
for the Air Force.

917
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:01,533
After the service,
I ran for Congress, and I won,

918
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:03,924
and what helped me
was the lesson

919
00:48:04,054 --> 00:48:07,405
that I took from
that fight with my old man,

920
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:10,060
and it's the one that
I carry with me to this day.

921
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:14,623
And that's that you can't
make everybody happy.

922
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:18,005
So you just gotta do
what you think is right.

923
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:24,382
Why don't you let
your campaign managers

924
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:25,916
tell that story to the press?

925
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:30,951
I think the work
defines the man,

926
00:48:32,213 --> 00:48:33,344
not the story.

927
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:40,830
My whole life I knew I was
gonna serve my country.

928
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:43,702
My dad was a Marine.

929
00:48:44,442 --> 00:48:46,662
[Gentle, somber music playing]

930
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:49,447
I barely remember him.

931
00:48:52,842 --> 00:48:56,193
Was an IED,
early days of Iraq,

932
00:48:57,064 --> 00:48:58,369
and, uh...

933
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:02,373
Well, Sam... [chuckles]

934
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:06,899
Sam was the black sheep
of our family

935
00:49:07,857 --> 00:49:11,252
for being in the Secret Service,
and not a military lifer.

936
00:49:13,123 --> 00:49:15,517
But he was the only one

937
00:49:15,647 --> 00:49:18,297
who didn't try and talk me
out of joining the Service.

938
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:25,222
It's in my blood.

939
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,576
Even if I-I wanted
to do something else,

940
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,271
I genuinely don't think I could.

941
00:49:31,794 --> 00:49:33,361
Guess the truth is I...

942
00:49:34,927 --> 00:49:36,929
I don't <i>want</i>
to do anything else.

943
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:42,022
Me neither.

[Gentle, dramatic music playing]

945
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,681
I'm sorry.

946
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:51,814
What for?

947
00:49:51,944 --> 00:49:53,250
For judging you.

948
00:49:54,947 --> 00:49:56,297
I'm one of those people.

949
00:49:56,949 --> 00:49:59,694
Everybody is one of those people
until they learn not to be.

950

[Gentle music playing]

951
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,047
I'll take the first watch.

952

Get some sleep, Mr. President.
You're gonna need it tomorrow.

Oh, God, I'm sorry,
Mr. President.

959

No apology necessary.

You'll never guess what they
put in the survival pack.

961

962

I've been better, sir.

989
00:53:14,712 --> 00:53:16,845
I think, at this point,

990
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:18,716
you should start
calling me Dallas.

991
00:53:18,847 --> 00:53:20,196
Can't do that, sir.

992
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:21,855
Just like your uncle.

993
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:23,417
Certainly hope so.

994
00:53:28,465 --> 00:53:30,772
I can see that
he's taught you so much.

995
00:53:33,731 --> 00:53:34,993
I'm sorry.

996
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:37,996
It's not fair to lose
someone that close to you.

997
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:40,260
He taught me everything.

998
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,526
He told me once,
"If life was fair,

999
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:47,919
the world wouldn't
need people like us."

1000
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:52,750
He was, um, trying to soften
the blow over some thing

1001
00:53:52,881 --> 00:53:54,361
I got passed over years ago.

1002
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:56,624
Tobias Masters?

1003
00:53:58,452 --> 00:53:59,452
You know about Toby?

1004
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,541
Of course.

1005
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:01,719
His uncle, the senator,

1006
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:03,848
is an insufferable prick,

1007
00:54:03,979 --> 00:54:06,764
and from what I gather,
so is the nephew.

1008
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:09,205
How do you know all that?
- Because I know everything

1009

about the people around me,
Agent Miles.

1010
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:15,469
Now, you tell me,

1011
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:19,168
what would Sam Waitman
do in this situation?

[Dallas] And what happened?

It was bought by
an American company,

who sold off machines,
closed the plant,

1054

01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:47,651
requesting permission to land.

1423
01:19:47,782 --> 01:19:49,044
I have Falcon on board.

1424
01:19:49,175 --> 01:19:51,225
Ramstein, this is
President Dallas Edwards

1425
01:19:51,264 --> 01:19:52,918
on board Air Force One.

1426
01:19:54,354 --> 01:19:56,051
Approaching from your east.

1427
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:58,445
Bring us on in.

1428
01:19:58,575 --> 01:20:01,491
[Engines roaring]

1429
01:20:01,622 --> 01:20:04,538
[suspenseful music playing]

1430
01:20:07,323 --> 01:20:09,573
[pilot] <i>Nice to have
you back, Mr. President.</i>

1431
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:23,644
[Music fades]

1432
01:20:23,774 --> 01:20:26,342
[dramatic music playing]

1433
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:30,132
[camera operator]
Mr. President, stand by.

1434
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:33,262
And three, two, one.

1435
01:20:35,525 --> 01:20:36,962
Good afternoon.

1436
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:41,662
It has been two weeks since
the downing of Air Force One,

1437
01:20:42,619 --> 01:20:44,069
and the tragic loss
of so many

1438
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:46,710
trusted colleagues
and friends.

1439
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:49,934
In the days to come,
there will be hearings

1440
01:20:50,018 --> 01:20:53,108
and investigations into
how this cowardly attack

1441
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:55,067
was planned
and executed.

1442
01:20:55,806 --> 01:20:57,808
The findings
will be made public.

1443
01:20:57,939 --> 01:21:01,508
Anyone found culpable
or complicit

1444
01:21:01,638 --> 01:21:03,031
will face
the full brunt

1445
01:21:03,162 --> 01:21:05,860
of the United States of
America's judicial system,

1446
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:09,124
and the unbearable weight
of her military might.

1447
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:13,781
I sit here
this evening, alive,

1448
01:21:14,956 --> 01:21:17,959
thanks to the bravery
and courageousness

1449
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:21,702
of our Secret Service agents
aboard Air Force One,

1450
01:21:21,832 --> 01:21:24,879
most of whom gave their lives
to ensure my protection.

1451
01:21:25,836 --> 01:21:29,057
These were my friends,
my confidants,

1452
01:21:29,797 --> 01:21:32,060
in many ways,
my family.

1453
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:35,411
<i>Our great nation
is no stranger to tragedy.</i>

1454
01:21:36,412 --> 01:21:40,460
<i>What is most important now
is how we respond,</i>

1455
01:21:41,722 --> 01:21:44,159
<i>what we do next.</i>

1456
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:46,683
<i>We will get up off of the mat.</i>

1457
01:21:46,814 --> 01:21:49,208
<i>We will live our fullest lives.</i>

1458
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:53,821
<i>We will adhere to our ideals
and our morals with integrity.</i>

1459
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:57,346
<i>That is how we will honor
those whom we have lost.</i>

1460
01:21:58,130 --> 01:22:01,046
<i>That is how we will
honor the heroes</i>

1461
01:22:01,176 --> 01:22:03,439
<i>who have given
their lives in service.</i>

1462
01:22:04,571 --> 01:22:07,922
<i>We will not lash out blindly
like a wounded animal.</i>

1463
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:10,838
<i>We will not engage
in the performative</i>

1464
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:14,189
<i>or theatrical
to soothe our fears.</i>

1465
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,018
<i>We will not declare war
on an abstract</i>

1466
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:19,455
<i>to regain
the illusion of control.</i>

1467
01:22:20,456 --> 01:22:23,894
<i>We will not repeat
the mistakes of our past.</i>

1468
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:27,289
<i>We will acknowledge
the uncomfortable reality</i>

1469
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,596
<i>that there will be those
that wish us harm.</i>

1470
01:22:29,726 --> 01:22:33,339
<i>Dangers will always linger in
the shadows of our vast world.</i>

1471
01:22:33,469 --> 01:22:35,471
Tyrants
will seek power,

1472
01:22:35,602 --> 01:22:38,431
and terrorists will
attempt to intimidate.

1473
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:41,608
And while we will
remain vigilant,

1474
01:22:42,174 --> 01:22:43,697
we must
also be sure

1475
01:22:43,827 --> 01:22:46,047
not to seed
the grounds of despair

1476
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:48,745
that allow their lies
and false promises to grow

1477
01:22:48,876 --> 01:22:50,617
in the minds
of the desperate.

1478
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:52,793
We will heal,

1479
01:22:54,012 --> 01:22:55,970
we will grow,

1480
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:58,842
and we will move
forward together.

1481
01:23:00,496 --> 01:23:01,889
May God bless you,

1482
01:23:03,021 --> 01:23:05,806
and God bless
the United States of America.
